# How to keep Flutter apps running in background on Android

This is a sample project that acts as a companion for an article that I wrote talking about some techniques to keep Flutter apps running. If you are interested you can find the article here: https://medium.com/@ppicas/keep-flutter-running-background-on-android-6ffc85be0234

## App features

This is simple Flutter app that when is opened it will show a screen with a counter that it's incremented every second. The interesting thing is that the counter never stops counting. No matter if you remove the app from recent apps or Android system kills the process to reclaim more memory. The app always recovers from any situation and keeps counting.
